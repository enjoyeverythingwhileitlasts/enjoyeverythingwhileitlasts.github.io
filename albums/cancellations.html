        <h1>cancellations</h1>
        <h2>cancellations is the 1 hour and 26 minute long 11 track ambient album, in this, there is a bit of experimenting with stuff (mainly from serious charges to sundown), at that time I made them tracks, I started listening to tape ambience and I kinda wanted to make my own, however, a four track costs a fair bit, so I had to experiment with plugins and thats the result. The photo cover was shot at same time and place for the cover value 889. Cancellations releases 27 June 2024.</h2>
