        <h1>controller</h1>
        <h2>controller is the 1 hour and 1 minute long 10 track noise album, it is also the first bit of material in my discograpy to be recorded from a mixer. It is also the first PX870 release to be announced in 2024 after about what, like 6 to 7 months of nothing for PX870. The first track is a reference to The KLF's track "Wichita Lineman Was a Song I Once Heard" from their 1990 album Chill Out.</h2>
