        <h2>
            Well, its that time again, a new ambient album, this is my last released work for the year as the end of the year approaches, anyways, the new album is called "volume 2" and if you want to know why I put released in brackets, its because it was supposed to release on the 12 December 2023, but I caused a problem with my service I use to get my music onto Spotify and other services, anyways, it contains 10 songs coming in about 53 minutes long, making it my second longest work.
