        <h2>
            It has been a while since I have released something under PX870, according to my spotify, it has been since September of last year. So its been a quite couple of months for PX870 but I am releasing a new 10 track noise album that lasts for one hour and one minute. I am also happy to say that some of the material on this album is from a mixer. The equipment I used in this will be on the bandcamp page for this album.
