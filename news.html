        <h2>
            The 5th EEWIL album is officially in the works, it will be about a character whos dying, each song is a memory for Xavier (you, the listener), just kinda like the ending track on m5sp, Xavier dies. However I feel like this album will be finished in a couple of days as I kinda make albums quite fast. The songs titles will be kinda like Example i Example ii so on and so on.
            Edit: The album now has a name, noderine. It will probably be released some time in August.
